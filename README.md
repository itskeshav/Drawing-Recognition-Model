# Drawing-Recognition-Model
The Drawing Recognition model project involved the development and deployment of a Deep Learning model capable of predicting animal names based on user-drawn images. The project utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to train a highly accurate model that could recognize drawings made by users. The training data for the model was obtained from the Quick Draw game.

The model was created to recognize drawings of six specific animals. By taking a user's drawing as input, the model could accurately identify the corresponding animal. To facilitate deployment, the Flask framework was employed, allowing the model to be hosted on both a local server and the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform.

The project covered the entire lifecycle of the model, from data acquisition and preprocessing to model training and deployment. The use of Deep Learning techniques, particularly CNN, enabled the model to achieve accurate predictions. The integration of Flask provided a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the model.

Overall, the Drawing Recognition model project showcased the successful implementation of Deep Learning, CNN, and Flask to develop an innovative solution for recognizing drawings and predicting animal names. The project demonstrated the capabilities of AI technology in solving real-world challenges and provided a foundation for further advancements in the field of image recognition and classification.
